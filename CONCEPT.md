# Network_Security

This project will focus on implenting a small network infrastructure for a XYZ company that will be compliant with the ISO:IEC 27001:2013 document. Most of the hardware components used in this topology are manufactured under the CISCO brand, nonethless other security products (such as IPS, IDS, NIDS, HIDS etc.) may be from another vendor. The idea of this work is to not focus on a specific vendor but rather to present the concept of implementing a small network in accordance with the above mentioned ISO standard.

ISO/IEC 27001 is an information security standard, part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, of which the last version was published in 2013.
